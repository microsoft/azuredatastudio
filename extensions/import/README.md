 ### Requirements

 ## How do I start the Flat File Import wizard?
 * In Azure Data Studio, press **Ctrl**+**I** to start the wizard.

 ### Why would I use the Import Flat File wizard?
This wizard was created to improve the current import experience leveraging an intelligent framework known as Program Synthesis using Examples ([PROSE](https://microsoft.github.io/prose/)). For a user without specialized domain knowledge, importing data can often be a complex, error prone, and tedious task. This wizard streamlines the import process as simple as selecting an input file and unique table name, and the PROSE framework handles the rest.

 PROSE analyzes data patterns in your input file to infer column names, types, delimiters, and more. This framework learns the structure of the file and does all of the hard work so users don't have to.
