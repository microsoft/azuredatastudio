# Server Reports for Azure Data Studio

Welcome to **Server Reports** for Azure Data Studio! Server Reports give useful insights about the server related to performance. These can be used to see current activity as well as historical activity. Here is a list of some of the available reports.

* DB Space Usage

This extension is inspired by SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)'s reports. We will continually add more useful server insights and tasks.

## Building your own reports
This extension is also useful as a sample dashboard extension. It demonstrates building a dedicated dashboard extension with a set of insights built in. You can get started building your own reports by following the [extension authoring guide].

See the [Server Reports Extension Project] in the Azure Data Studio repository on Github for the extension source code.
