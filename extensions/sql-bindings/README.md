# Microsoft SQL Bindings for VS Code

## Overview

Microsoft SQL Bindings for VS Code enables users to develop Azure Functions with Azure SQL bindings

### VS Code

This extension is bundled into the `SQL Server (MSSQL)` extension for VS Code and will be installed automatically when that extension is updated or installed.

## Getting Started with SQL Bindings
 **_NOTE:_** Currently, the SQL bindings extension only supports C# Azure Functions. JavaScript and Python Azure Functions support SQL bindings but are not supported by the SQL bindings extension at this time.

### From object explorer
* To create an Azure Function from a specific table in object explorer, right-click on a table in a connected server in object explorer and select `Create Azure Function with SQL Binding.` If you have not yet created the Azure Function project, the process will create one for you before populating the Azure Function.

### In an existing Azure Function
* Open the C# Azure Function in an editor and then run the `MS SQL: Add SQL Binding` command from the command palette to add a SQL binding to an existing function.

### From the command palette
* Run the `MS SQL: Create Azure Function with SQL Binding` command from the command palette to create a new function with a SQL binding. If you have not yet created the Azure Function project, the process will create one for you before populating the Azure Function.
