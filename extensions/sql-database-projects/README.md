# SQL Database Projects for Azure Data Studio and VS Code

## Overview

SQL Database Projects for Azure Data Studio and VS Code provides a way to design, edit, and publish schemas for SQL databases from a source controlled project.  For a complete development workflow, build and deploy your database projects in CI/CD pipelines, such as [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/azure/sql-action) or Azure DevOps.

## Features

- Develop database objects using T-SQL
- Store the database schema in source control

## Getting Started with Database Projects

* Create a new database project by going to the `Database Projects` view or by searching `Database Projects: New` in the command palette.
* Existing database projects can be opened by going to the `Database Projects` view or by searching `Database Projects: Open existing` in the command palette.
* Start from an existing database by using `Create Project from Database` from the command palette or database context menu.
* Start from an OpenAPI/Swagger spec by using the `Generate SQL Project from OpenAPI/Swagger spec` command (Preview).

## Settings

### General Settings
- `sqlDatabaseProjects.dotnetSDK Location`: The path to the folder containing the `dotnet` folder for the .NET SDK. If not set, the extension will attempt to find the .NET SDK on the system.
- `sqlDatabaseProjects.microsoftBuildSqlVersion`: Version of Microsoft.Build.Sql binaries used when building SQL projects that are not SDK-style SQL projects. If not set, the extension will use Microsoft.Build.Sql 0.1.9-preview.
- `sqlDatabaseProjects.netCoreDoNotAsk`: When true, no longer prompts to install .NET SDK when a supported installation is not found.
- `sqlDatabaseProjects.collapseProjectNodes`: Option to set the default state of the project nodes in the database projects view to collapsed. If not set, the extension will default to expanded.

### AutoRest Settings (preview)

- `sqlDatabaseProjects.nodejsDoNotAsk`: When true, no longer prompts to install Node.js when a supported installation is not found.
- `sqlDatabaseProjects.autorestSqlVersion`: Version of AutoRest.sql to use for generating SQL projects from OpenAPI/Swagger specs. If not set, the extension will use the latest version.
