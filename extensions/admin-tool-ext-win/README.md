# Database Admin Tool Extensions for Windows *(preview)*

The Database Admin Tool Extensions for Windows adds Windows-specific functionality into Azure Data Studio. Currently this
functionality includes the ability to launch a set of SQL Server Management Studio experiences directly from Azure Data Studio.

These experiences include:

* SSMS Property dialogs for select object types, such as Databases, Views, Stored Procedures and more
* The [Generate Scripts Wizard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/scripting/generate-and-publish-scripts-wizard)

### How do I launch these experiences?

Both of these are available as menu items on the context menu for nodes in the Object Explorer tree. Right click on a node that supports one of the experiences and select the appropriate item.

## Telemetry

This extension collects telemetry data, which is used to help understand how to improve the product. For example, this usage data helps to debug issues, such as slow start-up times, and to prioritize new features. While we appreciate the insights this data provides, we also know that not everyone wants to send usage data and you can disable telemetry as described in the Azure Data Studio [disable telemetry reporting](https://github.com/Microsoft/azuredatastudio/wiki/How-to-Disable-Telemetry-Reporting#how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting) documentation.
