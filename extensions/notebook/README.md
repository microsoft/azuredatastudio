# Notebook extension for Azure Data Studio

Welcome to the Notebook extension for Azure Data Studio! This extension supports core notebook functionality including configuration settings, actions such as New / Open Notebook, and more.

## Books in Azure Data Studio

Jupyter Book allows opening a single "Book" of related notebooks and markdown files. This feature will work if you open any Book folder in Azure Data Studio.

Download a [sample book](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book) and open folder in Azure Data Studio to get started. You can learn more about Books on the [Jupyter Book homepage](https://jupyter.org/jupyter-book/intro.html).

## Telemetry

This extension collects telemetry data, which is used to help understand how to improve the product. For example, this usage data helps to debug issues, such as slow start-up times, and to prioritize new features. While we appreciate the insights this data provides, we also know that not everyone wants to send usage data and you can disable telemetry as described in the Azure Data Studio [disable telemetry reporting](https://github.com/Microsoft/azuredatastudio/wiki/How-to-Disable-Telemetry-Reporting#how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting) documentation.
