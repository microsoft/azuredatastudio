# Microsoft Azure Arc Extension for Azure Data Studio

Welcome to Microsoft Azure Arc Extension for Azure Data Studio!

## Overview

This extension adds the following features to Azure Data Studio.

### Deployment Wizards

A gui-based experience to deploy an Azure Arc data controller as well as resources on an existing Azure Arc data controller. Current list of supported resources:
* SQL Managed Instance
* PostgreSQL server

### Management Dashboards

After connecting to an existing Azure Arc data controller in the **Azure Arc Controllers** view of the **Connections** viewlet a list of the active resources registered to the controller is shown, which allow launching a dashboard for further management capabilities.

## Usage Guide

### Deployment Wizards

* After installing this extension open the **Connections** viewlet
* Click on '...' in the top right corner of the viewlet panel and click on 'New Deployment...'.
* This opens a dialog box that shows several deployment tiles. This extension adds tiles for the supported resources listed above.
* Click on that tile, accept any license agreements, and choose the appropriate 'Resource Type' to install
* A required tools check will run, if any required tools are missing then instructions will be given for installing those tools
* Once the check has passed successfully then click the **Select** button
* This opens up a new dialog where you can enter input parameters specific to the deployment selected and then open a notebook that does the actual deployment.

### Controller View/Management Dashboards

* The **Azure Arc Controllers** view can be found in the **Connections** viewlet
* You can create a new controller by clicking the + button in the view title bar. This will launch the deployment wizard detailed above
* You can connect to an existing controller by clicking the plug button in the view title bar or the **Connect Controller** button in the view area when no controllers are registered
* You will then be prompted for the connection information to the controller, if it's successful then a node will be added to the tree for that controller
* Right click on one of the nodes to launch a dashboard for that resource - either the Data Controller or an instance deployed on it
