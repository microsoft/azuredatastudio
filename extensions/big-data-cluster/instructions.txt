How to update the Swagger-generated API to contact the controller

## BdcRouter API:
1. You need to get the API specification. Long-term you should be able to get from the server,
but for now go to the internal repository and find the checked in SwaggerClient.yaml there.

2. Copy the content from there, and add into https://editor.swagger.io/
3. Choose Generate Client, and choose Typescript-Node as the client to generate
4. This will download a zip file. Open it and copy contents of api.ts
5. Copy this content to apiGenerated.ts
- keep the copyright header and everything above the let defaultBasePath = xyz line,
- Override the rest of the file
6. Format the apiGenerated.ts file so it passes gulp hygiene

## TokenRouter and other APIs:
1. Get the API spec. This is available from a cluster at the address https://<ip>:30080/docs/swagger.json, where <ip> is the controller IP address.
2. Copy the content from there, and add convert from OpenApi 3.0 to Swagger 2.0 so we can use the Typescript-Node client generated by https://editor.swagger.io/.
Various converter tools are online. Alternatively, we might be able to use a different generator that has this client type (e.g. npm package @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli) but some require Java install.
3. Copy the converted Swagger 2.0 spec into https://editor.swagger.io/
4. Choose Generate Client, and choose Typescript-Node as the client to generate
5. This will download a zip file. Open it and copy contents of api.ts
6. Copy this content to tokenApiGenerated.ts
- keep the copyright header and everything above the let defaultBasePath = xyz line,
- Override the rest of the file
7. Format the tokenApiGenerated.ts file so it passes gulp hygiene
