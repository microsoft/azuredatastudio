## Contributing Issues

### Before Submitting an Issue
First, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/azuredatastudio/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed. Use this [query](https://github.com/Microsoft/azuredatastudio/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) to search for the most popular feature requests.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment.

:+1: - upvote

:-1: - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, submit an issue using the guidelines below.

## Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request.

* Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
* Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

The built-in tool for reporting an issue, which you can access by using `Report Issue` in Azure Data Studio's Help menu, can help streamline this process by automatically providing the version of Azure Data Studio, all your installed extensions, and your system info.

Please include the following with each issue.

* Version of Azure Data Studio (formerly SQL Operations Studio).

> **Tip:** You can easily create an issue using `Report Issues` from Azure Data Studio Help menu.

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) and what you expected versus what you actually saw.
* Images, animations, or a link to a video.
* A code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository we can easily pull down onto our machine to recreate the issue.

> **Note:** Because we need to copy and paste the code snippet, including a code snippet as a media file (i.e. .gif) is not sufficient.

* Errors in the Dev Tools Console (Help | Toggle Developer Tools)

Please remember to do the following:

* Search the issue repository to see if there exists a duplicate.
* Simplify your scripts around the issue so we can better isolate the problem.

Don't feel bad if we can't reproduce the issue and ask for more information!
