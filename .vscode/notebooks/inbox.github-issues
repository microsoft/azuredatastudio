Issues that the bot does not correctly triage are then triaged by a team member. The team rotates the inbox tracker on a weekly basis.\n\nA [mirror](https://github.com/JacksonKearl/testissues/issues) of the VS Code issue stream is available with details about how the bot classifies issues, including feature-area classifications and confidence ratings. Per-category confidence thresholds and feature-area ownership data is maintained in [.github/classifier.json](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/.github/classifier.json). \n\nðŸ’¡ The bot is being run through a GitHub action that runs every 30 minutes. Give the bot the opportunity to classify an issue before doing it manually.\n\n### Inbox Tracking\n\nThe inbox tracker is responsible for the [global inbox](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+no%3Aassignee+-label%3Afeature-request+-label%3Atestplan-item+-label%3Aplan-item) containing all **open issues and pull requests** that\n- are neither **feature requests** nor **test plan items** nor **plan items** and\n- have **no owner assignment**.\n\nThe **inbox tracker** may perform any step described in our [issue triaging documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issues-Triaging) but its main responsibility is to route issues to the actual feature area owner.\n\nFeature area owners track the **feature area inbox** containing all **open issues and pull requests** that\n- are personally assigned to them and are not assigned to any milestone\n- are labeled with their feature area label and are not assigned to any milestone.\nThis secondary triage may involve any of the steps described in our [issue triaging documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issues-Triaging) and results in a fully triaged or closed issue.\n\nThe [github triage extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-github-triage-extension) can be used to assist with triaging â€” it provides a \"Command Palette\"-style list of triaging actions like assignment, labeling, and triggers for various bot actions."
