/**
 * View contributions can include a `size`, which can be a number. A number works similar to the css flex property.
 *
 * For example, if you have 3 views, with sizes 1, 1, and 2, the views of size 1 will together take up the same amount of space as the view of size 2.
 *
 * A number value will only be used as an initial size. After a user has changed the size of the view, the user's choice will be restored.
